Arduino code for projects necessitating programming in a high-pace, ~2 weeks per project, semester long course. Projects focus on data computation with ESP communication.
---------------------------------------------
All projects were created as part of a team with fellow scholars Margaret Gile and Ben Albright.
Most projects utilized pre-existing software and electrical diagrams as a baseline for sensor operation.
